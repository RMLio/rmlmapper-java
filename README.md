# RMLMapper <!-- omit in toc -->

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/be.ugent.rml/rmlmapper.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22be.ugent.rml%22%20AND%20a:%22rmlmapper%22)

The RMLMapper execute RML rules to generate Linked Data.
It is a Java library, which is available via the command line ([API docs online](https://javadoc.io/doc/be.ugent.rml/rmlmapper)).
The RMLMapper loads all data in memory, so be aware when working with big datasets.

## Releases

The standalone jar file (that has a [commandline interface](#cli)) for every release can be found on the release's page on GitHub.
You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/releases/latest).
This is the recommended way to get started with RMLMapper.
Do you want to build from source yourself? Check [Build](#build).

## Build
The RMLMapper is build using Maven.
As it is also tested against Oracle (check [here](#accessing-oracle-database) for details),
it needs a specific set-up to run all tests.
That's why we recommend to build without testing: `mvn install -DskipTests=true`.
If you want, you can install with tests, and just skip the Oracle tests: `mvn test -Dtest=!Mapper_OracleDB_Test`.

A standalone jar can be found in `/target`.

Two jars are found in `/target`: a slim jar without bundled dependencies, and a standalone jar (suffixed with `-all.jar`) with all dependencies bundled.

## Usage

### CLI
The following options are most common.

- `-m, --mapping <arg>`: one or more mapping file paths and/or strings (multiple values are concatenated).
- `-o, --output <arg>`: path to output file
- `-s,--serialization <arg>`: serialization format (nquads (default), trig, trix, jsonld, hdt)

All options can be found when executing `java -jar rmlmapper.jar --help`,
that output is found below.

```

                                     concatenated). r2rml is converted to rml
                                     if needed using the r2rml arguments.
 -psd,--privatesecuritydata <arg>    one or more private security files 
                                     containing all private security

 --strict                            Enable strict mode. In strict mode, the 
                                     mapper will fail on invalid IRIs instead 
                                     of skipping them.
 -b --base-IRI <arg>                 base IRI used to expand relative IRIs in

                                     inside the provided mapping file.
                                                                 
```

#### Accessing Web APIs with authentication

The [W3C Web of Things Security Ontology](https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/security)
is used to describe how Web APIs authentication should be performed 
but does not include the necessary credentials to access the Web API.
These credentials can be supplied using the `-psd <PATH>` CLI argument.
The `PATH` argument must point to one or more private security files
which contain the necessary credentials to access the Web API.

An example can be found in the test cases 
[src/test/resources/web-of-things](src/test/resources/web-of-things).

#### Accessing Oracle Database

You need to add the Oracle JDBC driver manually to the class path
if you want to access an Oracle Database.
The required driver is `ojdbc8`.

- Download `ojdbc8.jar` from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/jdbc-ucp-122-downloads.html).
- Execute the RMLMapper via 

```
java -cp 'rmlmapper.jar:ojdbc8-12.2.0.1.jar' be.ugent.rml.cli.Main -m rules.rml.ttl
```

The options do the following:

- `-cp 'rmlmapper.jar:ojdbc8-12.2.0.1.jar'`: Put the jar of the RMLMapper and JDBC driver in the classpath.
- `be.ugent.rml.cli.Main`: `be.ugent.rml.cli.Main` is the entry point of the RMLMapper.
- `-m rules.rml.ttl`: Use the RML rules in the file `rules.rml`.ttl.
The exact same options as the ones mentioned earlier are supported.

### Library

An example of how you can use the RMLMapper as an external library can be found
at [./src/test/java/be/ugent/rml/readme/ReadmeTest.java](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/blob/master/src/test/java/be/ugent/rml/readme/ReadmeTest.java)

### Docker

#### Dockerhub

We publish our Docker images automatically on Dockerhub for every release.
You can find our images here: [rmlio/rmlmapper-java](https://hub.docker.com/r/rmlio/rmlmapper-java).

#### Build image

You can use Docker to run the RMLMapper by following these steps:

- Build the Docker image: `docker build -t rmlmapper .`.
- Run a Docker container: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data rmlmapper -m mapping.ttl`.

The same parameters are available as via the CLI.
The RMLMapper is executed in the `/data` folder in the Docker container.

### Including functions

There are two ways to include (new) functions within the RML Mapper
  * dynamic loading: you add links to java files or jar files, and those files are loaded dynamically at runtime
  * preloading: you register functionality via code, and you need to rebuild the mapper to use that functionality

Registration of functions is done using a Turtle file, which you can find in `src/main/resources/functions.ttl`

The snippet below for example links an fno:function to a library, provided by a jar-file (`GrelFunctions.jar`).

```turtle
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix doap:    <http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#> .
@prefix fno:     <https://w3id.org/function/ontology#> .
@prefix fnoi:    <https://w3id.org/function/vocabulary/implementation#> .
@prefix fnom:    <https://w3id.org/function/vocabulary/mapping#> .
@prefix grel:    <http://users.ugent.be/~bjdmeest/function/grel.ttl#> .
@prefix grelm:   <http://fno.io/grel/rmlmapping#> .
@prefix rdfs:    <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

grel:toUpperCase a fno:Function ;
  fno:name "to Uppercase" ;
  rdfs:label "to Uppercase" ;
  dcterms:description "Returns the input with all letters in upper case." ;
  fno:expects ( grel:valueParam ) ;
  fno:returns ( grel:stringOut ) .

grelm:javaString
    a                  fnoi:JavaClass ;
    doap:download-page "GrelFunctions.jar" ;
    fnoi:class-name    "io.fno.grel.StringFunctions" .

grelm:uppercaseMapping
    a                    fno:Mapping ;
    fno:function         grel:toUpperCase ;
    fno:implementation   grelm:javaString ;
    fno:methodMapping    [ a                fnom:StringMethodMapping ;
                           fnom:method-name "toUppercase" ] .
```

#### Dynamic loading

Just put the java or jar-file in the resources folder,
at the root folder of the jar-location,
or the parent folder of the jar-location,
it will be found dynamically.

> Note: the java or jar-files are found relative to the cwd.
You can change the functions.ttl path (or use multiple functions.ttl paths) using a commandline-option (`-f`).

#### Preloading

This overrides the dynamic loading.
An example of how you can use Preload a custom function can be found
at [./src/test/java/be/ugent/rml/readme/ReadmeFunctionTest.java](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/blob/master/src/test/java/be/ugent/rml/readme/ReadmeFunctionTest.java)

### Generating metadata

Conform to how it is described in the scientific paper [1],
the RMLMapper allows to automatically generate [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) metadata.
Specifically, you need the CLI arguments below.
You can specify in which output file the metadata should be stored,
and up to which level metadata should be stored (dataset, triple, or term level metadata).

```
 -e,--metadatafile <arg>          path to output metadata file
 -l,--metadataDetailLevel <arg>   generate metadata on given detail level
                                  (dataset - triple - term)
```

## Testing

Run the tests via `test.sh`.

#### Derived tests
Some tests (Excel, ODS) are derived from other tests (CSV) using a script (`./generate_spreadsheet_test_cases.sh`)

### RDBs
Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) running.

#### Problems
* A problem with Docker (can't start the container) causes the SQLServer tests to fail locally. These tests will always succeed locally.
* A problem with Docker (can't start the container) causes the PostgreSQL tests to fail locally on Windows 7 machines.

## Remarks

### Typed spreadsheet files
All spreadsheet files are as of yet regarded as plain CSV files. No type information like Currency, Date... is used.

### XML file parsing performance

The RMLMapper's XML parsing implementation (`javax.xml.parsers`) has been chosen to support full XPath.
This implementation causes a large memory consumption (up to ten times larger than the original XML file size).
However, the RMLMapper can be easily adapted to use a different XML parsing implementation that might be better suited for a specific use case.

### Language tag support

The processor checks whether correct language tags are not, using a regular expression.
The regex has no support for languages of length 5-8, but this currently only applies to 'qaa..qtz'.

### Duplicate removal and serialization format

Performance depends on the serialization format (`--serialization <format>`)
and if duplicate removal is enabled (`--duplicates`).
Experimenting with various configurations may lead to better performance for 
your use case.

### I have a question! Where can I get help?

Do you have any question related to writing RML mapping rules, 
the RML specification, etc., feel free to ask them 
here: https://github.com/kg-construct/rml-questions !
